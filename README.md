## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- src: the folder to maintain sources
- lib: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open .vscode/settings.json and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The SWING CALCULATOR view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Project Structure
- Calcuator with GUI: Based on Swing, located in the src/calculator Directory
